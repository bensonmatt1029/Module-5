# Overview

This project is a simple Pong game designed to enhance my skills as a software engineer and deepen my understanding of game development principles. Pong is a classic two-player arcade game where players use paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen. The objective is to score points by getting the ball past your opponent's paddle.

The purpose of writing this software was to practice working with graphical frameworks, understand collision detection, and develop interactive game mechanics. It also served as an opportunity to learn and apply concepts like event handling and real-time user input.
